# Portfolio

Welcome to my repository!<br>
Currently, work on the portfolio is in progress, as the progress is made, the content will be updated on a regular basis.

## About me

My name is Daria Stefańska-Polek. I graduated from Scandinavian studies at the Tischner European University in Krakow. I have been interested in testing for two years and I am learning on my own in my spare time. Recently, I also took steps to start my first full-time job as a software tester.

## Cooperation project

This is my project co-created with another tester. The work is in progress. I will be posting more material here.

## uTest

This section contains examples of issues I've reported and statistics of my activity on the platform on the uTest - crowdtesting platform.<br>
*I realize that my stats could be more impressive. However, I preferred to focus on theoretical learning so that I could take my first full-time job as a software tester. uTest, unfortunately, does not work in the long run, which I will gladly talk about during the job interview.*


Currently, **I am a member of a permanent team involved in regression testing of a mobile app** for a client related to the cosmetics industry.
