# Portfolio

Welcome to my repository!<br>
Currently, work on the portfolio is in progress, as the progress is made, the content will be updated on a regular basis.

## About me

My name is Daria Stefańska-Polek. I graduated from Scandinavian studies at the Tischner European University in Krakow. I have been interested in testing for two years and I am learning on my own in my spare time. Recently, I also took steps to start my first full-time job as a software tester.

Thank you for visiting my repository. It means a lot to me.

## My individual projects

I would personally call this section the most interesting. I will be adding more and more of my own projects here soon.

### Issues reports


### Test cases


## uTest

This section contains examples of issues I've reported and examples of test cases I've executed on the uTest - crowdtesting platform.

### Issues reports

### Test cases

I would like to emphasize that **the test cases were not written by me**. As a manual tester, I only dealt with execution.
