Welcome to my repository!
Currently, work on the portfolio is in progress, as the progress is made, the content will be updated on a regular basis.
## About me
My name is Daria Stefańska-Polek. I graduated from Scandinavian studies at the Tischner European University in Krakow. I have been interested in testing for two years and I am learning on my own in my spare time. Recently, I also took steps to start my first full-time job as a software tester. So thank you for visiting my repository. It means a lot to me.
